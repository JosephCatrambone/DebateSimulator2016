GUN_CONTROL,Good evening and welcome to the 2016 Presidential Debate.  Our first subject tonight: A recent news story chronicled a tragic accident in which a grandmother was shot by a toddler who had gotten hold of a firearm.  Do you believe this incident could have been avoided if the grandmother had had a gun with which to defend herself?
BUDGET_AND_ECONOMY,Last year we rented an inflatable bouncy castle for my child's 6th birthday.  This year the cost went up by nearly 50%.  What will you do as president to help curb inflation?
HEALTHCARE,Women are 99% more likely to die during childbirth than men. Why hasn't modern medicine addressed this issue?
CRIME,"On the subject of criminal justice and reform, do you support judgements involving multiple consecutive life-sentences in the electric chair for repeat offenders?"
NO_TOPIC,"That's all the time we have for this evening I'm afraid.  Thank you both for joining me."
